5,7c5,11
<  * This implementation uses a convolution to transform the input image into an image describing the
<  * number of rolls surrounding each roll. This intermediate image is then scanned for rolls with
<  * less than four neighbors.
---
>  * The previous implementation requires a complex conditional check in the innermost (and hottest)
>  * loop to ensure that the exterior of the image is interpreted as empty space (no rolls).
>  * Surrounding the original image with a perimeter of zeroes allows the inner conditional to be
>  * removed.
>  *
>  * Since the image has now been transformed from NxN to (N+2)x(N+2), the memory access patterns of
>  * some other loops have also changed.
